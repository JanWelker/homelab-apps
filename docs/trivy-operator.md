# Trivy Operator

Aqua Security's [Trivy Operator](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-operator/latest/)
scans everything the cluster runs and writes every result back as a Kubernetes
object. It is here rather than in the platform repository because nothing the
platform brings up depends on it.

## At a glance

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Namespace | `trivy-system` |
| Chart | `trivy-operator`, from `aquasecurity.github.io/helm-charts` |
| URL | None; it has no user interface |
| Dashboard | [Trivy Operator](https://monitoring.infra.k8s.wlkr.ch/d/trivy-operator-overview) |
| Database | None; findings are CRDs, so the [CloudNativePG rule](conventions.md#3-postgresql-is-always-a-cloudnativepg-cluster) does not apply |
| Storage | 5Gi `rook-ceph-block`, for the Trivy server's vulnerability database |
| Depends on | Monitoring (the `ServiceMonitor`), Rook-Ceph (the PVC) |
| Files | [`trivy-operator/`](https://github.com/JanWelker/homelab-apps/tree/main/trivy-operator): the chart, a `privileged` namespace, a default-deny policy, `prometheusrule.yaml` and a dashboard written for this cluster |

## What it scans

| Scanner | Produces | Answers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vulnerability | `VulnerabilityReport` | Which CVEs are in the images we run |
| Exposed secret | `ExposedSecretReport` | Which images have credentials baked in |
| Config audit | `ConfigAuditReport` | Which workloads are misconfigured |
| RBAC assessment | `RbacAssessmentReport` | Which roles grant too much |
| Infra assessment | `InfraAssessmentReport` | Whether the nodes pass CIS |
| Compliance | `ClusterComplianceReport` | CIS 1.23, NSA/CISA 1.0, PSS baseline and restricted |

The `eks-` and `rke2-` compliance specs are for other distributions and are
left out rather than reported as failing.

## Configuration

The values in `trivy-operator/application.yaml` that are not defaults:

| Setting | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `scannerReportTTL: 24h`, `scanOnlyCurrentRevisions`, `scanJobTTL: 10m` | Reports live in etcd. A stale report is rebuilt, superseded ReplicaSets are not scanned, and finished jobs do not accumulate |
| `builtInTrivyServer: true` | `ClientServer` mode: one `trivy-server` holds the vulnerability database on the PVC. Standalone mode downloads it in every scan job, which meets registry rate limits, and a rate-limited scan reports zero findings rather than an error |
| `ignoreUnfixed: false`, every severity | A finding with no fix is usually the signal that the base image is wrong, and a finding the scanner could not grade is worth reading |
| `ignorePolicy.nextcloud`, `ignorePolicy.authentik` | Those images carry thousands of unfixed Debian findings and their reports exceed the etcd request limit. The Rego (v0 syntax, `object.get` because `FixedVersion` is absent when there is no fix) drops only findings that have no fix *and* are below HIGH |
| `additionalVulnerabilityReportFields` without `Description` and `Links` | A report is one API write, capped at 2 MiB; `Links` alone is over half the payload. An oversized report is rejected with nothing but an operator log line. A description is one lookup away; an absent report is not |
| `operator.scanJobTimeout` and `trivy.timeout`, both 20m | The first is the Job's `activeDeadlineSeconds` and kills the pod whatever Trivy is doing; the second is Trivy's own flag and only fires if it is the shorter. Raising one alone does nothing |
| `clusterSbomCacheEnabled: false` | With the cache, every workload after the first to use an image gets an `SbomReport` from the cached SBOM and no `VulnerabilityReport`. Upstream: [trivy-operator#1668](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-operator/issues/1668) |
| `metricsVulnIdEnabled: false` | One series per CVE per container is a six-figure cardinality, and every label is already in the report |
| `compliance.reportType: summary` | The collector skips reports in `all` format, so `trivy_compliance_info` disappears and the dashboard's failing-controls table empties. The `status` label is title-cased: `Fail`, `Pass` |
| Control-plane tolerations on `nodeCollector` and `scanJobTolerations` | Without them the CIS infra assessment covers only the workers and reports a clean control plane it never looked at |
| Namespace `enforce: privileged`, `audit`/`warn: restricted` | node-collector hostPath-mounts `/var/lib/etcd`, `/var/lib/kubelet`, `/etc/kubernetes` and `/etc/cni/net.d`, which `baseline` forbids. Scan jobs themselves drop all capabilities and run read-only |
| `logDevMode: false` | Its `V(1)` lines are the only way to see decisions the operator makes silently, but it switches logging to console encoding. Turn it on to debug, then off |

## Alerting on the gap

`TrivyContainerNotScanned` in `prometheusrule.yaml` compares every running
container against the containers that have a `VulnerabilityReport` and names
the difference:

```promql
count by (namespace, container) (
  kube_pod_container_info
  * on (namespace, pod) group_left ()
  (max by (namespace, pod) (kube_pod_status_phase{phase="Running"} == 1))
)
unless on (namespace, container)
count by (namespace, container) (
  label_replace(trivy_image_info, "container", "$1", "container_name", "(.+)")
)
```

- **Keyed on `(namespace, container)`, not the digest**: containerd's
  platform digest and the registry's tag digest differ permanently for
  mirrored images.
- **Restricted to `Running` pods**, or every completed Job counts as unscanned.
- **`for: 2h`**, several times a full sweep, so the 24h TTL churn does not page.

The dashboard's stat and by-severity panels take `max by (image_digest)`
before summing, and workload panels join ReplicaSets against
`kube_replicaset_spec_replicas > 0`, so a finding counts once per image and a
superseded revision drops out. The "Worst workloads" table stays per container
on purpose: it answers where a finding runs.

## Usage

The dashboard is a summary; the objects have the detail.

```bash
# What has been scanned, worst first
kubectl get vulnerabilityreports -A --sort-by='.report.summary.criticalCount'

# The findings themselves, for one workload
kubectl get vulnerabilityreports -n <ns> <name> -o json \
  | jq '.report.vulnerabilities[]
        | select(.severity=="CRITICAL")
        | {id: .vulnerabilityID, pkg: .resource,
           installed: .installedVersion, fixed: .fixedVersion}'

# Misconfiguration, RBAC and node checks
kubectl get configauditreports -A
kubectl get rbacassessmentreports,clusterrbacassessmentreports -A
kubectl get infraassessmentreports -A

# Which compliance controls are failing
kubectl get clustercompliancereports k8s-cis-1.23 -o json \
  | jq '.status.summary, (.status.summaryReport.controlCheck[]
        | select(.totalFail > 0))'
```

## Health check

Reconcile running images against scanned ones; treat a difference as a missing
scan until proven otherwise:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A -o json \
  | jq -r '.items[].spec.containers[].image' | sort -u | wc -l
kubectl get vulnerabilityreports -A -o json \
  | jq -r '.items[].report.artifact.repository' | sort -u | wc -l
```

!!! danger "Zero is not the same as clean"
    A report that reads zero may be a clean image or a scan that failed: a rate-limited pull, a timeout, an image the operator could not resolve. Check the object exists and carries a real digest before believing a zero, and look at `kubectl -n trivy-system get jobs` when one never appears. This is where the [vulnerability-triage](https://github.com/JanWelker/homelab) skill starts.

## Pitfalls

Four ways a workload ends up with no `VulnerabilityReport`, all silent from
the outside:

| Symptom | Cause | Where to look |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No report, no `SbomReport`, operator logs `ResourceExhausted ... larger than max` or `etcdserver: request is too large` | The report exceeds the API write ceiling | Operator log. Fix: the fields and ignore policies above |
| No report, Job events show `DeadlineExceeded` | `scanJobTimeout` elapsed on a large image | `kubectl -n trivy-system get events --field-selector reason=DeadlineExceeded`, before `scanJobTTL` deletes the Job |
| Some containers of a multi-container workload missing; job succeeded; log has `failed to analyze layer ... unexpected EOF` | A scan container died reading the image and the operator keeps only containers that exited 0. Hits workloads with several containers on one image (Rook, Cilium). Not the shared cache: concurrent scans with it pass | Scan job pod logs |
| `SbomReport` exists, no `VulnerabilityReport` | SBOM cache reuse path ran `trivy sbom` and produced nothing | Confirm `clusterSbomCacheEnabled` is off |

A completed scan job counts against `concurrentScanJobsLimit` until
`scanJobTTL` deletes it, so a backlog drains in batches of ten every ten
minutes; that is the expected shape, not a stall.

## Why it replaced Kubescape

- Images whose SBOM exceeded a size ceiling were silently reported as zero
  findings, and the operator lacked the RBAC to replace the oversized record.
- Results sat behind an aggregated API server on its own PVC, so "is this
  number real" became a storage question.
- The scanner image had to be pinned ahead of the chart to get scheduled scans
  working.

Trivy Operator stores plain CRDs and uses the same Trivy as CI. What was lost
is relevancy: Kubescape's eBPF agent could mark a finding as loaded at runtime,
and that argument now has to be made from the workload's configuration.
